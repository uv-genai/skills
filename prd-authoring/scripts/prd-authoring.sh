<!-- What does this requirement enable? What user need does it address? -->
<!-- Be specific about behavior, not implementation -->
<!-- Example: "System shall allow users to save multiple payment methods for future use" -->

**User Story** (Optional but helpful)
<!-- As a [user type], I want [capability], so that [benefit] -->
<!-- Example: "As a returning customer, I want to save my payment method, so that I can check out faster on future purchases" -->

**Inputs**
<!-- What data or actions trigger this functionality? -->
<!-- Example: "User clicks 'Save payment method' checkbox during checkout" -->
<!-- Example: "Payment details: card number, expiration date, CVV, billing address" -->

**Outputs**
<!-- What results or changes occur? -->
<!-- Example: "Payment method stored securely with last 4 digits shown" -->
<!-- Example: "Confirmation message displayed to user" -->

**Business Rules**
<!-- Any constraints or special conditions? -->
<!-- Example: "Maximum 5 payment methods per user" -->
<!-- Example: "Credit card validation must occur before saving" -->

**Acceptance Criteria**
<!-- Specific, testable conditions that must be met -->
<!-- Use Given/When/Then format or checklist format -->

- [ ] Given [precondition], when [action], then [expected result]
  - Example: "Given user has <5 saved methods, when they save a new payment method, then it appears in their payment methods list"
- [ ] Given [precondition], when [action], then [expected result]
  - Example: "Given user enters invalid card number, when they attempt to save, then error message displays and payment method is not saved"
- [ ] [Testable criterion]
  - Example: "Saved payment method can be selected during future checkout"

# Epic Breakdown: $project_name

<!-- This document decomposes the PRD into independently deliverable epics -->
<!-- Purpose: Create a logical decomposition that enables parallel work and incremental delivery -->

## Epic Decomposition Guidelines

<!-- Follow these principles when defining epics: -->

**What makes a good epic?**
- **Independently deliverable**: Can be shipped and provide value on its own
- **Right-sized**: Completable in 2-4 sprints (4-8 weeks)
- **Clear scope**: Well-defined boundaries of what's included/excluded
- **Aligned with objectives**: Directly supports one or more PRD objectives
- **Testable**: Has clear success criteria from the PRD
- **Minimal dependencies**: Reduces blocking between teams/sprints

**Common decomposition strategies:**
- By user journey (onboarding epic, checkout epic, etc.)
- By functional area (authentication epic, payment epic, analytics epic)
- By technical layer (frontend epic, API epic, data migration epic)
- By user persona (admin tools epic, end-user features epic)

---

## Epic 1: [Epic Name]

<!-- Use a descriptive name that captures the essence of what's being built -->
<!-- Example: "User Authentication & Authorization" -->
<!-- Example: "One-Click Checkout Experience" -->

### Objective

<!-- What does this epic achieve? What value does it provide? -->
<!-- Connect to PRD objectives - which objective(s) does this epic support? -->
<!-- Example: "Enable users to securely save payment methods and checkout with a single click, reducing checkout time from 3 minutes to 30 seconds (supports Objective 1: Reduce cart abandonment)" -->

### Scope

<!-- What specific features and capabilities are included in this epic? -->
<!-- Be concrete and specific - these become the basis for user stories -->

**Core Features**:
- [Feature/capability 1]
  - Example: "User can save up to 5 payment methods to their account"
- [Feature/capability 2]
  - Example: "User can select saved payment method during checkout"
- [Feature/capability 3]
  - Example: "User can set a default payment method"

**Supporting Features**:
- [Feature/capability]
  - Example: "User can edit or delete saved payment methods"
- [Feature/capability]
  - Example: "System validates payment methods before saving"

### Requirements Coverage

<!-- Which specific PRD requirements does this epic address? -->
<!-- Reference PRD requirement numbers (FR1, FR2, NFR1, etc.) -->

**Functional Requirements**:
- FR1: [Requirement name from PRD]
  - Coverage: [Complete / Partial - specify what's included]
- FR3: [Requirement name from PRD]
  - Coverage: [Complete / Partial - specify what's included]

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
- NFR2: Security
  - Coverage: Payment data encryption, PCI compliance
- NFR3: Reliability
  - Coverage: Error handling for payment service failures

### Success Criteria

<!-- What must be true for this epic to be considered successful? -->

## Epic Dependencies & Sequencing

<!-- This section visualizes how epics relate and the recommended order -->
<!-- Understanding dependencies helps with sprint planning and parallel work -->

### Dependency Diagram

\`\`\`
Epic 1: [Name] (Foundational - no dependencies)
  │
  ├─→ Epic 2: [Name] (Depends on Epic 1)
  │     │
  │     └─→ Epic 4: [Name] (Depends on Epic 2)
  │
  └─→ Epic 3: [Name] (Depends on Epic 1)

Epic 5: [Name] (Independent - can be done in parallel)
\`\`\`

### Recommended Sequence

<!-- Provide a concrete plan for tackling epics -->
<!-- Consider: dependencies, team capacity, business priorities, risk reduction -->

**Phase 1** (Sprints 1-3):
- Epic 1: [Name]
  - Rationale: [Why this comes first]
  - Example: "Must complete foundational authentication before other features can build on it"

**Phase 2** (Sprints 4-6):
- Epic 2: [Name] (Depends on Epic 1)
- Epic 3: [Name] (Depends on Epic 1) - Can run in parallel with Epic 2
  - Rationale: [Why these are next and can be parallel]

**Phase 3** (Sprints 7-9):
- Epic 4: [Name]
- Epic 5: [Name] - Can run in parallel with Epic 4
  - Rationale: [Why these come last]

**Critical Path**: Epic 1 → Epic 2 → Epic 4
<!-- The critical path determines minimum timeline -->
